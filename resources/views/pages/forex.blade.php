             <h3>What is Forex?</h3>
                <p>
                    Forex is the shortened form for Foreign Exchange; forex exchange is a global market where currencies are being traded against each other.
                    With the help of forex, an American can easily purchase things in France merely by converting their fund electronically.
                <p>
                    Market players use forex to sway against international currency and interest rate risk, to speculate geopolitical events that might affect a coin at a particular time.

                    Currencies are traded against each other as exchange rate pairs. E.g., GBP/USD is a currency pair for changing the British pound against the U.S dollar. 

                    Due to the worldwide reach of trade, commerce, finance, globalization, forex markets tend to be the largest and most liquid asset market globally, with daily trading of over 7 billion dollars per day.  

                    Interestingly, the Forex market is open 24 hours a day, five and a half days a week, and currencies are traded worldwide in the major financial centers of Frankfurt, Hong Kong, London, New York, Paris, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo, and Zurich, and across almost every time zone.Â 

                    Forex, Forex exchange, FX, and currency market can be interchangeably. However, the FX market is pretty volatile.

                    How do people make profits in Forex?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    There are two ways one can make money in the Forex market, and this is the interest rate differential between two currencies; that is, one can make a profit by leveraging on the interest between two currencies by buying currency with a high-interest rate and selling it at the lower interest rate.
                    Also, the second but most popular way of making money is through changes in the exchange rate; this is the famous well-known now method of making money in Forex. A practical example of this is if you bought the GPS at 2.5, and in a couple of hours, the exchange rate has moved to 3.0; one has already made 0.5 profit in that specific trade; this is vice-versa. 
                </p>
                The internet makes Forex easier because one can now trade currency individually; in the past, most currency traders were hedge funds, influential individuals, and multinational companies, and this is because of the vast fund required to trade Forex then.
